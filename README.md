# Web Pentomino game/also stayed as my 11th grade school project

**Here you can test and play with it - https://suupp.github.io/penta-final/**


## Rules

There is a field of blocks on the left of the screen. The purpose is to fill the whites with figures that are given on the right side of the screen.

### *Placing a figure on the field*
Firstly simply click on a figure, it will be selected(sadly, there is no feedback when selecting, I thought it wasn't necessary for such small project). Then you should hover on a field and see the projection of that figure. When you picked the place you want, simply click on a field.

### *Setting different modes*
There are some buttons on the bottom, their names are pretty self-explanatory, but anyway.

**Solve** button makes an automatic solving of a game. Sometimes it's slow when the volume of whites is big(10x10 field for example).

**Clear** button simply resets the field.

**Random field** button generates another field the size you set on the first load of the page.

**Rectangle field** button makes all black blocks white, so you just get the clear field of whites.

**All figures** button gives an access to all existing figures.
